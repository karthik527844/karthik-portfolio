# PROCESS DOCUMENT – Gesix Sprint 01

## 1. Architecture
The portfolio was built as a Single Page Application using React with Vite for faster development and optimized performance. The project follows a component-based architecture where each UI section (Hero, Tech Stack, Projects, Footer) is isolated into reusable components. Data such as skills and projects are stored separately to ensure scalability and maintain clean separation of concerns.

## 2. AI Usage
AI tools were used to accelerate development by scaffolding React components, improving layout structure, and ensuring responsiveness. Prompts were engineered to focus on clean code generation, accessibility, and Lighthouse performance optimization. All generated code was reviewed and modified to ensure full understanding and correctness.

## 3. Challenges
One challenge faced was maintaining responsive layouts across different screen sizes. This was resolved by using CSS grid with auto-fit and minmax properties, ensuring the UI adapts smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.
